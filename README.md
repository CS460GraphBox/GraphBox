# Description
GraphBox is a game that consists of 2 custom games based on Obby and Geometry Dash, GObby! and BoxDash respectively. This game will also allow you to choose to play as one of five characters: any of the GraphBox team members or Professor Daniel Haehn, from the University of Massachusetts Boston. There is also a Christmas-themed lobby from which you can enter portals to enter any of the two games.

Beware of where you jump in GObby, or else you will fall out of the sky and plummet to your demise.

Beware of where you land in BoxDash, the lava will set you on fire and meet your demise.

# Future Improvements
The team acknowledges that there are improvements to be made in the game, as we expand this game to all Roblox players. 

For BoxDash, we have a few ideas. First, we would like to implement a leaderboard for multi-player lobbies. Imagine playing BoxDash with your friends in a race for the fastest time through all three levels. Another interesting concept is the idea of a relay race. For example, for a team of three players, each player would complete one of the levels and the time to complete all three levels would be combined.

For GObby!, the first improvement the team would make is to create a leaderboard similar to how the BoxDash one would work. Additionally, we would like to create more maps and provide the ability for players to choose a map to play.

# Authors and acknowledgment
Thanks to: 
- Linda Do for helping with the character sprites and models, and scripts to ensure character swap, allowing the users to play with different characters,
- Allyson Ochoa for creating the map, designing, and implementing GObby!, with checkpoints and varying dynamics of the blocks,
- Brendan Nguyen for designing and implementing BoxDash, while adding difficulty to each level with scripts, and
- Wilhen Alberto Hui Mei for creating the lobby and making sure that the portals and teleports worked properly, and helped with writing scripts in both games.

We all contributed to this CS460 - Computer Graphics project, here at the University of Massachusetts Boston. We applied everything we learned in this course into this project, such as lighting manipulation, camera positioning, implementing tools such as Blender to create graphical models, Roblox Studio, and many more. Special thanks to Professor Daniel Haehn for giving us the idea to implement this game in Roblox, and for guiding us to continually improving as a developer. Can't forget the CS460 staff! Thank you guys for everything! 

Overall, we'd like to thank the Roblox community for providing models and scripts that are open-source and ready to be used by developers. The scripts mostly come from tutorial YouTube videos and from Roblox Developer forums that have people help resolve common bugs and problems (similar to StackOverflow). Most of the credits go to the following YouTubers: AlvinBlox, Pandastroyer, Thinknoodles, WillTango, coolcapidog, and many more.
